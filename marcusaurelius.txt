“Be like a rocky promontory against which the restless surf continually pounds;
 it stands fast while the churning sea is lulled to sleep at its feet.
 I hear you say, "How unlucky that this should happen to me!" Not at all!
 Say instead, "How lucky that I am not broken by what has happened
 and am not afraid of what is about to happen. The same blow might have struck anyone,
 but not many would have absorbed it without capitulation or complaint.”
